 * Threading model:
 * One main thread handles all I/O, and does some initial packet processing
 * that is not CPU-intensive. Once a packet passes the basic checks, it
 * is handed off to a thread pool with thrpool_req, where cryptographic tasks
 * are performed.
 * There are two sources of packets: the OS-specific packet intercept
 * mechanism, and an ICMPv6 socket. This file handles the intercepted
 * ND packets. The ICMPv6 packets of interest are RA, CPS, and CPA,
 * which are handled by their respective files.
 * If sendd is built withouth multi-threading support, thrpool_req
 * simply calls the function directly.
